This is a Custom Rom build from sources for HTC Desire, by me - roalex.

Im using the AOSP sources, CyanogenMod Sources and Evervol Sources.

HTC and Google do not support our device, or even our CPU class (8x50), neither dose CAF, so everything has to be done from scratch, thanks to all who contributed.

Drewis - he has done most of the work - https://github.com/drewis
Rapmv78 - for the camera hal, HW kernel support, etc https://github.com/Rapmv78
cayniarb - for the orignal 8x50 ICS kernel - http://tiamat-dev.com
CyanogenMod - even if they don't support this devices its great to relay on a good framework offering all kind of goodies to the users.


Main support offered on XDA - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=24542016#post24542016
